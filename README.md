> "The magic used in the Marauder's Map creation is advanced and impressive; it includes the Homonculous Charm, enabling the possessor of the map to track the movements of every person in the castle." - [Pottermore](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-marauders-map)

This program takes advantage of [ArcGIS API for Javascript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/sandbox/sandbox.html?sample=fl_featureCollection) and the ability to introduce [MapBox tilets as basemaps in ArcGIS](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2013/04/01/using-stamen-and-mapbox-tilesets-as-basemaps-in-arcgis-com/) to make [The Marauder's Map a reality](http://www.maraudersmap.online/).

# Try it!

## 1. Internally position yourself in your home / business

Follow [the instructions for learning yourself indoors, using a computer or android phone](https://github.com/schollz/find#quickstart).

Then change the name to the following: `original=latitude=longitude=floor`.

You can get the latitude and longitude by going to [OpenStreetmap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), *double-cliking* on a position, and then copying the coordinates in the URL. (See highlighted in picture)
